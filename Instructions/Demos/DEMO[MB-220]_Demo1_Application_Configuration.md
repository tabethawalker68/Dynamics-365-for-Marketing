# Module 1: Configure Dynamics 365 Marketing
## Demo 1.1: Prepare Marketing Environment 
----

Demo Overview
============

Scenario
--------

Contoso is an insurance company that has outgrown their single-send marketing
software and is looking to obtain a more holistic view of their marketing
efforts to help facilitate sales.

Contoso already has Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps. Because of its
seamless integration, the marketing department decides to move forward with
Dynamics 365 Marketing.

Contoso already has email templates they have been using in their previous
software. They want to transfer their marketing assets along with their contact
list to the new system.

Lab Overview
------------

This lab compromises of two exercises:

1.  In the first exercise, you will upload image files to be used in marketing
    pages and emails.

2.  In the second exercise, you will import accounts and contacts to Dynamics
    365 Marketing from csv files.

 What you’ll need:
------------------

-   A computer or VM with a Dynamics 365 Marketing environment

-   10 image files to be used in marketing content and 2 csv files containing
    Contoso contact and account data. These can be found in the AllFiles folder on GitHub, or may be distributed directly by your MCT.

Exercise 1: Upload marketing content 
=====================================

Contoso wants to use the same images from their current system. To so do, you
will need to upload the marketing assets to Dynamics 365 Marketing.

1.  Download the image files from the resource documents. Extract the files to a
    folder on your desktop.

2.  Navigate to <office.com> and sign in with your **admin** credentials.

**Important:** Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Discourage students from using any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. This exercise should **only be completed by the MCT using the admin credential.**

3.  Expand the side menu and select **Dynamics 365.** From the list of available apps, select **Marketing** to open the Dynamics 365 Marketing app.

5.  The Marketing app will open. In the left menu, navigate to **Files** in the Marketing Content section. Click the **+ Upload**
    button to open the upload files window. Click **+ Add files**, locate the files on your local computer, and select them. 

4.  While the upload window is open, add the keywords “logo” and “contoso” to
    the contosologo image file. Since this is a new system, keywords will need
    to be created instead of selected. When you’re done adding keywords, finish
    the upload.

5.  Ensure 10 images files uploaded.

6.  Using the search bar, type “con” and hit enter. Ensure the Contoso logo
    appears in the search results.

7. These files will now be available for all the users to incorporate into their marketing operations.
